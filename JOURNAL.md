(Fast, rugged, and 3D Printed RWD RC car with 2x Drone BLDC motors)

### ðŸ“… Day 1: Concept Dump & Sketchboard

**Time Spent:** \~4 hrs
Started with tea and chaos. Ideas everywhere.

* Took out my notebook and dumped every rough sketch and half-baked idea from my brain â€” 2-axle, RWD layout only.
* Dual 1000KV A2212 motors on a shared GT2 pulley? Seemed overkill â€” so obviously, I went with it.
* Most online builds go PVC or aluminum; I decided to ditch that route and go full plastic â€” everything 3D printed, down to the last washer if I can help it.
* Thought up an articulated rear pod setup that can pivot, giving some faux-suspension. Chassis up front remains a fixed spine with steering.
* Jotted down a barebones BOM: motors, pulleys, 3D printed couplers, MG996R servo, ESCs, bearings â€” basically whatever was still lying around in my parts bin.

ðŸ“Œ Challenge for the week: everything must be printable on a 220x220 bed without hacks or multi-part gluing. Game on.

### ðŸ“… Day 2: Rear Drive Module â€” Core Drivetrain

**Time Spent:** \~5 hrs
Fusion 360 in full throttle.

* Modeled the two A2212s mirrored so that both feed power into a common GT2 pulley sitting on a central 5mm rear axle.
* Designed custom hex wheel hubs that slide onto the same axle â€” no differential, both wheels spin together.
* Built a dual-motor bracket with motor-shaped cutouts for perfect fitment and integrated belt tensioning slots.
* Added reinforcement ribs to the pulley holder to prevent flex and cracking during torque surges.
* Every component snaps or bolts in. No glue. No nonsense. Rear pod is its own module â€” hot-swappable like a racing drone arm.

ðŸ§  Spent too long figuring out how to keep belt tension steady under axle twist. Settled on an upper roller system and wider belt flanges. Feels robust now.

### ðŸ“… Day 3: Front Axle Steering â€” Simplified Ackermann

**Time Spent:** \~4 hrs
Steering â€” the one thing I didn't want to deal with, but had to.

* Created basic steering knuckles with pivot arms and short stub axles for the front wheels.
* MG996R servo directly links to a drag link â†’ tie rod setup â€” clean, minimal, enough play to avoid binding.
* Tried to respect Ackermann geometry, but not obsessively. Itâ€™s an off-roader, not an F1 car. Close enough works.
* Servo is mounted in a recessed cavity just above the axle for protection and wire clearance.
* The front axle mounts to the chassis using a four-point bolt system for tool-free replacement.

ðŸ›ž The best part? Knuckles designed for tool-less wheel swap. No more fiddling with microscopic hex screws in sand.

---

### ðŸ“… Day 4: Chassis Spine & Mounting Layout

**Time Spent:** \~5 hrs
Built the skeleton â€” and itâ€™s modular.

* The chassis is a long, rail-based spine. All components slide and bolt onto it like train cars on a track.
* Built in mount interfaces for: front steering axle, rear pod pivot, battery tray underneath, ESCs, and RX unit.
* Routed zip tie guides, wire tunnels, and ventilation directly into the side walls â€” no spaghetti wiring here.
* Kept the entire layout symmetrical and modular, so I can redesign just one module without touching the rest.
* Divided the frame into 3 printable pieces, each <200mm, with tabs and pegs for clean snap-fit and alignment.

ðŸŽ¯ Printability, repairability, airflow, and tool access â€” all baked in by design, not as afterthoughts.

---

### ðŸ“… Day 5: Suspension Mock & Rear Articulation

**Time Spent:** \~4 hrs
Time to make it *bounce*.

* Mounted the rear drive pod to the main spine using a central pivot â€” it swings under load like a rocker arm.
* Added placeholders for suspension arms, with shock-ready slots and enough travel for chunky terrain.
* Used parametric modeling for the shock mounts â€” lets me change angles and lengths without redrawing the model.
* Designed low-friction pivot bushings using standard 3mm metal rods. No fancy parts, just smart tolerances.
* Battery tray now partially sinks into the chassis base, keeping center of gravity low and stable.

ðŸ¤˜ The rear pod now kind of hangs under the car â€” gives it a vibe somewhere between Baja buggy and hover tank.

---

### ðŸ“… Day 6: Full Assembly & Clash Check

**Time Spent:** \~4 hrs
Time to bolt it all together in CAD.

* Imported all modules â€” front, rear, middle â€” into a master assembly file to check geometry, fit, and clearance.
* Ensured GT2 belt passes cleanly under chassis without snagging, and that motor wires donâ€™t tangle or rub.
* Verified servo horn angles and steering clearance across full travel. No binds, no weird overlaps.
* Refined a few part tolerances, and added thread-start chamfers on every screw hole â€” no cross-threading nightmares.
* Created a basic tire model with knobby tread just to visualize the final look and get hyped.

ðŸ§© Honestly feels like building with LEGO Technic â€” everything slots, clicks, or bolts. Canâ€™t wait to print.

### ðŸ“… Day 7: Print Prep & BOM Review

**Time Spent:** \~4 hrs
Pre-flight check before the print storm begins.

* Carefully oriented every STL for minimal supports, stronger layer lines, and easier cleanup.
* Named every part version clearly: no `final_final_v6_real_this_time.stl` garbage.
* Rechecked part tolerances by digitally simulating fit using the caliper tool in Fusion.
* Added pegs, keys, and markers for straight, idiot-proof assembly during the print phase.
* Final filament estimate: \~380g of PLA, roughly 11-12 hours print time, give or take failed first layers.

ðŸ§¾ BOM spreadsheet now includes part name, weight, print time, number of parts, and assembly notes. OCD achieved.

### âœ… Status Update:

All CAD files are finalized, clean, and exported. STL folder is locked and ready for slicing. Currently waiting for the real-world bits to show up:

* 2x 1000KV A2212 BLDC Motors
* GT2 5mm Pulley + 200mm Belt Kit
* 2x 30A ESCs + Radio Receiver

Once they land, the print marathon begins. Letâ€™s see if this thing screams or melts.
