# KX-36: BLDC RC Off-Road RWD Racecar
Designed and Built by AVSC

---

## Overview:

KX-36 is a rear-wheel-drive, off-road RC car powered by 2x 1000KV A2212 drone motors using a single GT2 belt system. It’s completely 3D printed – every component, from the steering knuckles to the chassis spine, was made to fit a standard 220x220mm bed. The goal? No glue, no epoxy, no weird slicing. Just bolts, nuts, and a lot of plastic.

The design is modular, overbuilt, and intentionally fun.

## Development Log:

Day 1 – Concept Dump

Day 2 – Rear Drivetrain Module

Day 3 – Front Steering System

Day 4 – Chassis Spine

Day 5 – Rear Articulation

Day 6 – Full Assembly in CAD

Day 7 – Print Prep

---

### File Structure (for organization):

KX-36

* STLs
* Final BOM
* Render Previews
* README.txt (this file)
* JOURNAL.md

---

### Printing Tips:

Material: PETG
Layer Height: 0.2mm
Infill: 40–60% for strength
Supports: Minimal or none needed
Brim: Recommended for tall or thin parts
Print Volume: All fits in 220x220mm bed

---

## Project Status:

CAD work is complete. All STL files are ready and prepped.
Waiting for hardware to arrive:

* 2x A2212 1000KV Motors
* 1x GT2 Pulley Kit
* 2x 30A ESCs
* 1x Receiver and Transmitter

Printing will start as soon as parts arrive. Fingers crossed it drives and doesn’t catch fire.

---

### Future Plans:

* Replace dummy shocks with real dampers (Wltoys Aluminum ones)
* Add TPU tires or hybrid print rubbers
* Add telemetry (speed, temp) via Arduino or Pi
* FPV camera for POV racing
* Optional 4WD version with extra motors

---

### Tools Used:

| Onshape – 3D modeling
| 3ding – 3d Print service
| TinkerCAD – Early sketches
| Github – README editing
